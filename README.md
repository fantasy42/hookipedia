**Hookipedia** is a comprehensive documentation website for discovering, evaluating, and understanding high-quality custom React hooks. Think of it as Wikipedia for the React hooks ecosystem.

- Evaluate hook quality and edge case handling
- Understand implementation details and trade-offs
- Discover alternative hooks for the same problem
