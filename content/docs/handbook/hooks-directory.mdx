## Explore the Collection

The Hookipedia collection is a curated set of production-ready hooks designed to handle complex state, optimize performance, and bridge Web APIs with React's concurrent rendering. Browse the directory below to find the specific tool for your architectural needs.

## Foundation Hooks

These hooks solve core React patterns, ensuring your components remain flexible, reusable, and performant across different rendering environments.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="useControllableState"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-controllable-state"
  >
    Seamlessly support both controlled and uncontrolled component patterns without duplicating state logic or API surface.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useComposedRefs"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-composed-refs"
  >
    Merge multiple refs into a single callback ref. Fully compatible with React 19 cleanup functions and legacy RefObjects.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useIsoLayoutEffect"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-iso-layout-effect"
  >
    Automatically switches between `useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect` to eliminate hydration warnings in isomorphic apps.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Optimization & Performance

Hooks engineered to minimize re-renders, reduce network overhead, and handle asynchronous logic gracefully.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="useDebouncedState"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-debounced-state"
  >
    Manage debounced state updates in uncontrolled inputs to minimize expensive operations like heavy re-renders.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useDebouncedValue"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-debounced-value"
  >
    Delay updates to a controlled value, ideal for synchronizing search inputs with expensive API-driven filters.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useAbortableEffect"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-abortable-effect"
  >
    Provide automatic cleanup for async effects using `AbortController` to prevent race conditions and memory leaks.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Browser & Web APIs

Declarative wrappers around native Web APIs that handle the "boring parts" like global listeners, timers, and cleanup.

<Cards>
  <Card
    title="useMediaQuery"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-media-query"
  >
    Reactive, SSR-safe media query detection optimized with `useSyncExternalStore` and global listener sharing.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useEventListener"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-event-listener"
  >
    Declarative event management for DOM elements, window, or document with automatic listener cleanup.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="useClipboard"
    href="/docs/hooks/use-clipboard"
  >
    A streamlined interface for the Clipboard API featuring automated state management and high reliability.
  </Card>
