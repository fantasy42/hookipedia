## Welcome to Hookipedia!

If you've ever found yourself writing the same React logic over and over, or scouring the internet for a reliable `useDebounce` hook only to find ten different versions with varying levels of documentation, you've come to the right place.

**Hookipedia is a curated encyclopedia of custom React hooks.** Think of it as your friendly, trustworthy guide to reusable React logic. Our mission is simple: to help you write better code, faster, by providing a collection of high-quality, well-explained custom hooks in one central, dependable location.

## The Problem

In modern React development, custom hooks are superpowers. They let you encapsulate behavior, share logic across components, and build on a foundation of clean, reusable code. But that power comes with a challenge. Great hooks are scattered across blog posts, GitHub gists, and npm packages of varying quality. It's time-consuming to evaluate each one, understand its edge cases, and decide if it's right for your project.

## The Solution

Hookipedia solves this by being that single source of truth. Every hook in our collection is presented on a standardized, in-depth page designed for evaluation and learning. We've done the curation and deep dive so you don't have to. For each hook, you'll find:

- **Clean, production-ready source code** you can copy with confidence.
- A clear explanation of _how it works_ and _why it's built that way_.
- **Real-world use cases and examples.**
- Considerations about **pitfalls and performance**.
- Thoughtful **comparisons to alternative approaches** or similar hooks.

## What You'll Find Here

In the main **Hooks** section, you'll discover our curated library. Whether you're looking to simplify state management, handle side effects, interact with browser APIs, or optimize performance, each hook page is built to give you everything you need to make an informed decision and implement it effectively.

We're excited to have you here. Let's build something amazing together, one reusable hook at a time.
