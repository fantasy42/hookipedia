## How to Use Hookipedia

Hookipedia is designed to be intuitive and immediately useful. Here’s a practical guide on how to navigate the site and get the most out of each hook's documentation.

### The Standard Hook Page Layout

Every hook follows a consistent documentation structure to help you find information quickly:

- **Overview**: A high-level summary of what the hook does and its common use cases.
- **The Snippet**: The complete, production-ready source code. This is the heart of the page.
- **How It Works**: A line-by-line or concept-by-concept walkthrough of the code.
- **Usage Example**: Practical, copy-pasteable examples of the hook in action within a component.
- **Pitfalls & Considerations**: Important notes on edge cases, performance, and common mistakes to avoid.
- **Alternatives**: When appropriate, we suggest other hooks or native solutions that might fit your scenario better.

### Implementing a Hook in Your Project

Follow these steps to quickly integrate a hook from Hookipedia into your codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <h4>Choose Your Hook</h4>

    Browse the gallery or search for the functionality you need. Read the **Overview** to confirm it matches your use case.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h4>Copy the Code</h4>

    Copy the complete hook from **The Snippet** section. You can paste it directly into a file in your project (e.g., `/src/hooks/useYourHook.js`).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h4>Integrate and Adapt</h4>

    Use the **Usage Example** as a reference. Import the hook into your component and adapt the logic if needed to fit your specific requirements and codebase conventions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installation Options

Hooks on Hookipedia are provided as standalone functions. You have two straightforward options:

1.  **Copy-Paste:** The primary method. Simply copy the snippet into a local file in your project (e.g., `/src/hooks/`) and import it where needed.
2.  **Adaptation:** These hooks are templates. Feel free to modify the code—rename variables, adjust logic, or extend functionality to perfectly suit your project's needs.

Now you're ready to start building smarter. Head over to the [Hook Gallery](/docs/hooks/use-abortable-effect) to find your first hook!
